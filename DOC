CHALLENGE 1
When you head over to http://locahost:5000 (or whatever shows up as your URL when you run main.py),
you should have a <h1> that says My Library and link <a> to Add New Book.

    1- Load ' requirements.txt ' on the Terminal " pip install -r requirements.txt ".

    2- In main.py =>
    @app.route('/')
    def home():
    #I set the return to the index.html
    return render_template('index.html')

    2.0 I 'run' the main.py and had this an error:
        ---     from jinja2 import Markup, escape
        ImportError: cannot import name 'Markup' from 'jinja2'

    2.1 To overcome the error : " pip uninstall  Flask Jinja2 "
        =>
        " pip install Flask Jinja2 "
        ( the Jinja2 from the seen to be an old version, by uninstalling the old and installing a recent it is working,
         once the main.py is "Run" again  the localhost address is working)

CHALLENGE 2
When you head over to the /add path, e.g. http://locahost:5000/add you should see a form like the one below:
    1. Add the 'add.html' file to the @app.route("/add")

CHALLENGE 3
Make the form on the /add path work so that when you click "Add Book" the book details gets added as a dictionary
to the list called all_books in main.py.
